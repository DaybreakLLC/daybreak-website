Open Source Intelligence (OSINT): OSINT refers to intelligence obtained from publicly available sources such as websites, social media platforms, news articles, academic research, and other publicly accessible information. OSINT involves collecting, processing, analyzing, and disseminating information obtained from these open sources. It can provide valuable insights into various subjects, including geopolitical events, emerging trends, public sentiment, and more.

All-Source Intelligence: All-source intelligence involves the integration and analysis of information from various sources, including both open source and classified sources. It aims to provide a comprehensive and holistic understanding of a particular subject or situation by leveraging multiple data streams. All-source intelligence analysts gather information from a wide range of sources, including OSINT, human intelligence, signals intelligence, imagery intelligence, and others. By combining these different sources, analysts can create a more complete picture of a specific target, threat, or situation.
