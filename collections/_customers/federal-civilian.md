For our Federal Civilian agency customers we bring the talent and lessons learned across the entire spectrum of our DOD, Intellignece, and Commercial work and apply it to the management of our nation's natural resources, the protection of our population, and the planning, response and recovery when natural disaster strikes.  In all of these missions, we apply our geospatial expertise in using remote sensing, LiDAR, mobile device data, GIS, and custom applications for resource planning and risk assessment.
